## Overview

The Creative Design Hub is structured to accommodate different types of design work. By organizing designs into specific categories, we aim to create a well-structured and easily navigable space for all designers. Each design type has its own directory, and within each directory, designers can create subfolders for their projects. Each project folder should include a README file that explains the design, and if applicable, an assets folder containing necessary assets.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash

    cd creative-design-hub
    ```

3. **Explore the design types:**

    Navigate to the `product-design`, `3d-design`, or `graphic-design` directories to see the different projects.
